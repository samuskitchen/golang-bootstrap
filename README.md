- [go-chi](https://github.com/go-chi/chi)
- [go-chi/cors](https://github.com/go-chi/cors)
- [golang-migrate](github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/v4)
- [go-cmp](https://github.com/google/go-cmp)
- [godotenv](https://github.com/joho/godotenv)

## Requirements
- Golang 14+
- Docker
- Docker Compose
- go-swagger
  * It is necessary to have this plugin installed, this is the installation process:
    ```bash
        go get -u github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger
        cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger
        go install ./cmd/swagger
    ```
## Generate Mock Interface
This is an automatic mock generator using mockery, the first thing we must do is go to the path of the file that we want to autogenerate:

Download the library
```go
go get -u github.com/vektra/mockery
```

We enter the route where you are
```bash
cd path
```

After entering the route we must execute the following command, Repository this is name the interface
```bash
mockery --name Repository
```

## Documentation
This is the command that runs the swagger autogenerated documentation
* the document can be generated in the following formats in:
  * yalm
  * json
```bash
swagger generate spec -o ./swagger.json --scan-models
```

This is the command to start the server with the documentation
* You can generate the documentation in _swagger_ and _redoc_ that is changed in the variable `-F=`
```bash
swagger serve -F=redoc swagger.json
```

Raise the server without automatic start, with specific port and path
````bash
swagger serve -F=redoc --host=0.0.0.0 --port=8082 --no-open swagger.json
````

You can get more information in the Swagger documentation:
```http request
localhost:8082/docs
```

## Test commands for the project
These are the commands to run the unit and integration tests of the project

#### Execute All Test
This is the command to run the white box tests, and the test report command
```go
go test -v -coverprofile=coverage.out -coverpkg=./application/... ./test/...

go tool cover -html=coverage.out
```
This command gets the total coverage of the project
```go
go tool cover -func coverage.out
```

#### Beer Test Handler
The command to run the handler tests, and the command to generate the report
````go
go test -v -coverprofile=coverage.out -coverpkg=./application/beer/delivery/v1/ ./test/beer/delivery/v1

go tool cover -html=coverage.out
````

#### Beer Test Repository
The command to run the repository tests, and the command to generate the report
````go
go test -v -coverprofile=coverage.out -coverpkg=./application/beer/repository/... ./test/beer/repository

go tool cover -html=coverage.out
````

#### Beer Test Use case
The command to run the use case tests, and the command to generate the report for these tests redis must be above
````go
go test -v -coverprofile=coverage_integration.out -coverpkg=./application/beer/usecase/ ./test/beer/usecase

go tool cover -html=coverage.out
````

## Quick Run Project
First clone the repo then go to beer-api-clean-arch folder. After that build your image and run by docker. Make sure you have docker in your machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/samuskitchen/beer-api-clean-arch.git

cd beer-api-clean-arch
```

#### Start Api
```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```

* If you get this following error :
  ```
  ERROR: could not find an available, non-overlapping IPv4 address pool among the defaults to assign to the network
  ```

  it is because you have an active VPN turn it off or disconnect, so the docker compose can work


#### Down Api
```bash
docker-compose down --remove-orphans --volumes
```
